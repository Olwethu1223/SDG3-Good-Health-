Healthcare Data Analysis Using Machine Learning
SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being
Problem Addressed
This project addresses Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by analyzing healthcare data to identify patterns in patient care, medical conditions, and healthcare costs. The analysis aims to improve healthcare resource allocation and patient care strategies.

Machine Learning Approach
K-means Clustering for Patient Segmentation

Algorithm: Unsupervised K-means clustering
Features Used:
Age
Billing Amount
Medical Condition
Preprocessing:
Standard scaling of numerical features
Label encoding of categorical variables
Configuration: 4 clusters with random state 42
Results
Patient Segmentation

Identified 4 distinct patient clusters
Each cluster represents different combinations of age groups and healthcare costs
Clear patterns emerged in medical condition distribution across clusters
Key Findings

Age and billing amounts show strong clustering patterns
Medical conditions are not evenly distributed across age groups
Certain clusters show higher healthcare costs
Ethical Considerations
Data Privacy

Patient data must be anonymized
Secure storage and handling of sensitive health information
Compliance with healthcare data protection regulations
Fairness and Bias

Clustering results should not lead to discrimination in healthcare access
Age-based grouping must not result in healthcare disparities
Regular monitoring of cluster assignments for potential bias
Implementation Concerns

Results should support, not replace, clinical decision-making
Healthcare providers should maintain human oversight
Regular validation of clustering results needed
Recommendations
Use findings to optimize resource allocation
Develop targeted preventive care programs
Monitor cost patterns for different patient groups
Regular model updates with new data
Maintain transparency in decision-making processes
This analysis provides valuable insights for healthcare management while maintaining ethical considerations and patient privacy at its core.
