Project Title: Healthcare Data Analysis Using Machine Learning
SDG Goal: SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being

🌍 The Global Problem
Health systems worldwide face challenges like rising healthcare costs, unequal access, and inefficient resource distribution. These issues often result in overwhelmed hospitals, delayed treatment, and poor health outcomes — especially in vulnerable communities.

In line with Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, our project explores how machine learning can support smarter healthcare decisions, improve patient care strategies, and optimize resource allocation.

🤖 AI-Driven Solution
We built a K-Means Clustering model to segment patients based on healthcare data, including:

Age
Billing Amount
Medical Condition
The goal was to uncover hidden patterns in the data and divide patients into distinct groups. These insights can help:

Predict which patients need high-cost care
Tailor preventive programs for specific age groups
Allocate hospital resources more effectively
🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Type: Unsupervised Learning
Algorithm: K-Means Clustering
Preprocessing:
Standard scaling of numerical features (e.g., Age, Billing)
Label encoding for medical conditions
Model Setup: 4 clusters, random_state=42
📊 Key Results
The model identified 4 unique patient clusters with distinct characteristics:

Cluster	Avg Age	Avg Billing	Common Condition
0	69.3	R4,112	Asthma
1	47.2	R2,431	Hypertension
2	55.5	R7,744	Hypertension
3	30.5	R5,090	Diabetes
Insights:

Older patients with asthma had moderate costs.
Patients in their 50s with hypertension contributed to the highest billing group.
Younger diabetics may benefit from early intervention programs.
🧪 Ethical & Social Considerations
🔐 Privacy

All patient data was anonymized (synthetic dataset used for this demo).
Future implementations must comply with health data protection laws.
⚖ Fairness & Bias

Grouping by age or condition must not result in discriminatory treatment.
Models must support — not replace — healthcare professionals' decisions.
Regular evaluation is required to ensure equity and fairness in care delivery.
✅ Conclusion & Impact
This project shows how AI, specifically unsupervised learning, can uncover meaningful patterns in healthcare data — offering a data-driven approach to improving health outcomes and reducing system strain.

By aligning machine learning with SDG 3, we demonstrate that technology can be a powerful ally in achieving universal health and well-being.
